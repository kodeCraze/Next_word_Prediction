# Next_word_Prediction
Next_word_Prediction is a project that uses Jupyter Notebook and TensorFlow to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context of the sentence.

## Overview

The Next_word_Prediction project is designed to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context of the sentence. This is achieved by training a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Jupyter Notebook. The model is trained on a dataset of sentences and their corresponding next words.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following command:
